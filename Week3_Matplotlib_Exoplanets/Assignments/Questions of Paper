What are the main factors determining the mass-radius distributions of planets, and what planet categories do these distributions reveal?

    The main factors determining the mass-radius distributions of planets include the composition of their cores (rocky, icy, or gaseous) and the presence of gaseous envelopes. These distributions reveal four primary planet categories: rocky worlds (less than 2 Earth radii), super-Earths (2-3 Earth radii), sub-Neptunes (3-4 Earth radii), and gas giants (greater than 4 Earth radii).

How do growth models explain the formation processes and mass distributions of planets?

    Growth models explain the formation processes and mass distributions of planets by simulating the accumulation of material around a planetary core. Rocky cores accumulate material to become super-Earths, icy cores can grow into sub-Neptunes, and large icy cores can attract significant gas envelopes to become gas giants. These models align with observed mass-radius distributions and suggest that different initial conditions and accretion processes lead to the variety of planets observed.

How do Monte Carlo simulations support the observed radius distribution, and what insights do these distributions provide about planet formation?

    Monte Carlo simulations support the observed radius distribution by accurately reproducing the bimodal nature of sub-Neptune masses and the distinct categories of planets. These distributions provide insights into planet formation by indicating that rocky and icy cores grow through different mechanisms, with larger cores more likely to attract and retain gaseous envelopes. The simulations suggest that multiple small icy cores can merge to form larger icy planets, like Uranus and Neptune, and that the evaporation of atmospheres leads to the observed radius gaps.
